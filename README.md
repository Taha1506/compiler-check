# compiler-project
We implemented a compiler for c-minus language (A simplified version of c programming language).

In the first phase we implemented the scanner to tokenized the input into words.

In the second phase we used LR parsing method to parse the input and build the parse tree.

In the third phase we changed the grammer and added action symbols and their corresponding functions to generate three address codes from the c minus code.
